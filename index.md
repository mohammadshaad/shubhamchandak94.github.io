Hi! Welcome to my site. I am Shubham Chandak (शुभम चांडक), fourth year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford. My Ph.D. advisor is Prof. [Tsachy Weissman](http://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/). I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (India) in 2016. I am interested in bioinformatics, data compression, DNA storage, information theory and machine learning.

I practise Vipassana meditation. Vipassana is a non-sectarian meditation technique that aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation. Find out more [here](https://www.dhamma.org/).
