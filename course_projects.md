Here are some of the course projects I have done while in Stanford.

- **Implementation and analysis of stabilizer codes in pyQuil**  
  CS 269Q: Quantum Computer Programming  
  Spring 2018-19  
  Stanford University  

  Stabilizer codes form a large family of quantum error correcting codes that includes well-known codes such as Shor code, Steane code, CSS codes and toric codes. In this work, we build a framework for encoding and decoding of general stabilizer codes on pyQuil and test specific single qubit codes with standard quantum noise models.

- **Codes for DNA storage**  
  EE 388: Modern Coding Theory  
  Spring 2017-18  
  Stanford University  

  - Studied the trade-off between coding density and reading efficiency for DNA storage.
  - Proposed practical error-correction schemes based on RaptorQ codes, BCH codes and LDPC codes.
  - Proposed schemes for constrained coding using Fibonacci codes.
  - Achieved close-to-optimal results for a range of error rates.

- **Understanding the Amazon Rainforest from Space using CNNs**  
  CS 231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  
  Spring 2016-17  
  Stanford University  

  - Participated in Kaggle contest “[Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space)” by Planet Labs.
  - Tested various architectures for multi-class, multi-label prediction of weather and land-use features based on satellite images of the Amazon rainforest.
  - Received Bronze medal from Kaggle for getting leaderboard rank of 67 among 938 teams.
